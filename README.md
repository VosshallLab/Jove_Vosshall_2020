# Jove_Vosshall_2020
This folder contains raw data and scripts for:
1. Jove et al. 2020 "Sensory Discrimination of Blood and Floral Nectar in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes" (Neuron)
2. Jove et al. 2020 "The Taste of Blood in Mosquitoes" (bioRxiv)

## Folders and their contents:

Figure references refer to Neuron version, unless explicitly stated as corresponding to bioRxiv version.

**RNAseq_merged_annotation**

This folder contains the merged annotation used to analyze RNA-seq data and the Transcripts Per Million (TPM) data file related to Figure 7D and Figure S6A-E. Sequencing reads have been deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA605870.

bioRxiv version: related to Figure 7D and Figure S4


**Calcium_imaging**

This folder contains the script used to calculate peak deltaF/F for all calcium imaging experiments (as depicted in Figure S3A-D), to generate heatmaps (related to Figure 4G, Figure 5D,Figure 6G,H, Figure S4A, and Figure S7E) and to perform clustering (related to Figure 5G-I, Figure S4, and Figure S5). 

bioRxiv version: heatmaps (related to Figure 4G, Figure 5D,Figure 6G,H, and Figure S3A) and clustering (related to Figure 5G-I and Figure S3). 

**Clustering_validation**

This folder contains the Supplemental Report and script for the clustering validation analyses performed in Figure S5. 

this analysis was performed after bioRxiv version was posted.

**Raw_data**

This folder contains raw data for figures plotted in Prism, corresponding to the bioRxiv version. For these data, Prism was also used to perform the statistical test indicated in Jove et al., 2020 figure legends (Figure 1E,F,J,L,M; Figure 2C-E; Figure 3C,D; Figure 4H,J; Figure 5B,E,F; Figure 6J,L; Figure 7B,C,G-J; Figure S1D-J; Figure S3B; and Figure S5C,D). 

**Raw_data_Neuron**

This folder contains raw data for figures plotted in Prism, corresponding to the Neuron version. For these data, Prism was also used to perform the statistical test indicated in Jove et al., 2020 figure legends (Figure 1E,F,J,L,M; Figure 2C-E; Figure 3C,D; Figure 5B,E,F; Figure 6J,L; Figure 7B,C,G-J; Figure S1D-J; Figure S3E-G; Figure S3E-G; Figure S4B-D; Figure S6F-K; and Figure S7E). 

**Data_File_1_Neuron**

This file corresponds to the raw data that accompanies the Neuron version.
