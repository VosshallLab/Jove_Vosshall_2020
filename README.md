2. Jove et al. 2020 "The Taste of Blood in Mosquitoes" (bioRxiv)

## Folders and their contents:

Figure references refer to Neuron version, unless explicitly stated as corresponding to bioRxiv version.

**RNAseq_merged_annotation**

This folder contains the merged annotation used to analyze RNA-seq data and the Transcripts Per Million (TPM) data file related to Figure 7D and Figure S6A-E. Sequencing reads have been deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA605870.


**Calcium_imaging**

This folder contains the script used to calculate peak deltaF/F for all calcium imaging experiments (as depicted in Figure S3A-D), to generate heatmaps (related to Figure 4G, Figure 5D,Figure 6G,H, Figure S4A, and Figure S7E) and to perform clustering (related to Figure 5G-I, Figure S4, and Figure S5). 


**Clustering_validation**

This folder contains the Supplemental Report and script for the clustering validation analyses performed in Figure S5. 

**Raw_data**

This folder contains raw data for figures plotted in Prism. For these data, Prism was also used to perform the statistical test indicated in Jove et al., 2020 figure legends (Figure 1E,F,J,L,M; Figure 2C-E; Figure 3C,D; Figure 4H,J; Figure 5B,E,F; Figure 6J,L; Figure 7B,C,G-J; Figure S1D-J; Figure S3B; and Figure S5C,D).
